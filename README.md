# microbit-pi-data
Log micro:bit sensor data as a CSV on a Raspberry Pi and serve it as a graph in a webpage

## What you need

- A BBC micro:bit
- Any old Raspberry Pi, I used an old model B with a 'lite' version of the Raspberry Pi OS that has no GUI.
- A micro USB cable to connect the micro:bit to the Pi
- Er, that's it

## How to make it work

[blocks in MakeCode](microbit-serial-logger-1line-string.png)
Flash the HEX file above onto the BBC micro:bit. If you want to edit the program, you can drag and drop the HEX file on to the MakeCode editor or paste in the text in the .JS version of the file, also included in this repo.
